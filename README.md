# Python Code Repository

This repository is designed to keep Python code and related files organized for easy access and reuse.

## Directory Structure

*   **`src/`**: Contains primary Python source code modules (.py files).
    *   Reusable functions, classes, and modules should be placed here.
*   **`notebooks/`**: For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files).
    *   Useful for experimentation, data analysis, and visualization.
*   **`scripts/`**: Holds standalone Python scripts (.py files).
    *   These are typically scripts used for automation, specific tasks, or command-line tools.
*   **`data/`**: For storing data files (e.g., CSV, JSON, text files) that your code might use or generate.
    *   A `.gitkeep` file is included to ensure the directory is tracked by Git even when empty.
*   **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests for your Python code.
    *   Writing tests helps ensure your code is reliable and works as expected.
*   **`docs/`**: For any supplementary documentation.
    *   This can include more detailed explanations of your code, project architecture, or usage guides.

## How to Use

1.  **Add new Python modules:** Place your `.py` files containing reusable code into the `src/` directory.
2.  **Add Jupyter notebooks:** Save your `.ipynb` files into the `notebooks/` directory.
3.  **Add utility scripts:** Put your standalone `.py` scripts into the `scripts/` directory.
4.  **Store data:** Place any necessary data files into the `data/` directory.
5.  **Write tests:** Add corresponding tests for your code in the `tests/` directory.
6.  **Document your work:** Use the `docs/` directory for any further documentation.

## Version Control

It's highly recommended to use Git for version control. This will help you track changes, collaborate with others (if applicable), and revert to previous versions if needed.

*   `git add <file>` to stage changes.
*   `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"` to save changes.
*   `git push` to upload your changes to a remote repository (like GitHub or GitLab).
